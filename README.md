## General info

An e-commerce site, created using **TypeScript** with **Next.js 13** and styling with **Tailwind**. Product data, stored in the **MongoDB Atlas** database, is partially pre-rendered on the server side and then retrieved and displayed progressively using "infinite scroll". Graphics are stored on **uploadthing.com**, and payments of selected products are processed using **Stripe** (in this project Stripe payments are in test mode). The site is responsive and created with fast performance in mind.
